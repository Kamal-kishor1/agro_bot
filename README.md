Project Samarth -> it is a Challenge Question by Bharat Digital Fellowship - 2026 Cohort (Data Science)

-> The Vision: Government portals like data.gov.in are repositories for thousands of valuable, high-granularity datasets     
   that are released by the government for the public to use. However, the data exists in varied formats and structures across different ministries, making it difficult for policymakers and researchers to derive the cross-domain insights needed for effective decision-making.

-> Your Mission: Your mission is to design and build a functional, end-to-end prototype of an intelligent Q&A system/chat 
   interface over this data. This system must source its information directly from the live data.gov.in portal of the Indian Government to answer complex, natural language questions about the nation's agricultural economy and its relationship with climate patterns.
